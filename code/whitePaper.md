The Language of Geometry
========================


Introduction
------------

As we believe in compositionallity and the ability to manipulate abstract
symbols in the brain, we are designing a language of geometry that allows for
this kind of operation. This is a proof of concept whose goal is to be
a proposal for a way to describe planar shapes in such a way that, with
a compositional semantics and cost function on the programs, the associated ---
unique modulo noise in the representation --- shape should match a human notion
of complexity.

The primitives were added so that relevant shapes, that we will describe
later on, feel intuitive to draw using the language. The same goes for
the complexity function.

Intuitive Semantics
-------------------

A program either starts with 3 set values for the possible amount of noise or
it does not, in which case default values are used. Then the body of a program
is either a concatenation of bodys, with the usual syntax `;`, or an
instruction. Let us detail these a bit more.

### What is intuitive

 * A `Number` is a number : simple operations are resolved, a single value is
   defined so far and this is `pi`.
 
    If you think we need more operations tell me or make a pull request, if it's
    easy to write in OCaml it's easy to add here.

 * `{}` is an empty program that does nothing.

 * At some point, the semantics of `Undefined` will be defined. In the meantime,
   it is not defined.

       Think of it as adding infinity to the language, but with a *I don't know
       where to stop* rather than an *I will never stop* semantics.

### What is less so

#### `Save(string)` & `Load(string)`

These two instructions are used to respectively store and restore the current
context, or continuation. You can see it used in both the person example, with
a very simple use case of keeping positions stored, and in the star example
where it is dynamically over written.

#### `DiscreteRepeat(Number) { Program }`

This takes a Number as an argument, arbitrarily transforms it to an integer (it
just usually rounds it down, don't worry. See OCaml's Pervasive.int_of_float
for more details), executes the given Program the specified mount of time.

Note that it only concatenates the program so far: if you want to play with
backtracking, repetitions with/without modifications, and so on, you have to
play around with `Save` and `Load`.

#### `SetValues(...)` & `Integrate(Number)`

These are the core instructions to understand. Imagine the program as a set of
instructions for your hand, holding a pencil, drawing something on a piece of
paper: `SetValues(...)` prepares the movement, the acceleration, and so on,
while `Integrate(Number)` executes it during an arbitrary unit of **time**.

More specifically, you can set four values with SetValues (the order doesn't matter and there are default values for the forgotten one):

 * **s** is the speed
 * **a** is the acceleration
 * **t** is the curvature (t stands for &#952;)
 * **t**' is the variation of the curvature


The default values are respectively `s = 1`, `a = 0`, `t = 0` and `t' = 0`
which means that if you `Integrate(100)` without changing anything, you'll go
straight forward at constant speed for 100 units of times.

#### `Turn(Number)`

This operates an *on the spot* rotation of the hand, the angle depending on the
argument. The square example is the most straightforward use of this
instruction.

*Remark*: this is syntactic sugar in terms of semantics with `Turn(θ)` being
the same as `SetValues(s=0,t=θ) ; Integrate(1)`

Formal Semantics
----------------

As everything is not completely decided yet, the semantics of a program at any
given moment is given by its operation semantics for the available interpreter
I wrote. This is going to change one we move on to adding complexity, because
by this time the semantics will need to be fully specified.
