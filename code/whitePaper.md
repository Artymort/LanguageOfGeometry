Introduction
------------

We believe and will try to demonstrate that the human brain has the ability to
create very abstract mental representation of *pure* geometrical objects even
though all we can ever perceive are noisy representation of these.

This works through what we will designate as a *Language of Geometry*, LoG,
that can manipulate abstract rules and symbol to move between different layers
of representations, from what we noisily draw to what we see when we see
a not-quite-perfect circle.

Recurrence of simple geometrical shapes in human cognition

While prehistoric figurative drawings are common in caves, especially in
western Europe --- see for example @Otte2017155

Many shapes can be found through the prehistoric age, such as
[spirals](http://www.google.com/images?q=Kerbstones+Knowth+Newgrange&tbm=isch)


### In the history of mathematics

### In children

Shape perception as program inference

### Design Choices --- Informal Semantics

A program either starts with 3 set values for the possible amount of noise or
it does not, in which case default values are used. Then the body of a program
is either a concatenation of bodys, with the usual syntax `;`, or an
instruction. Let us detail these a bit more.

#### What is intuitive

 * A `Number` is a number : simple operations are resolved, a single value is
   defined so far and this is `pi`.

    If you think we need more operations tell me or make a pull request, if it's
    easy to write in OCaml it's easy to add here.

 * `{}` is an empty program that does nothing.

 * At some point, the semantics of `Undefined` will be defined. In the
   meantime, it is not defined.

       Think of it as adding infinity to the language, but with a *I don't know
       where to stop* rather than an *I will never stop* semantics.

#### What is less so

##### `Save(string)` & `Load(string)`

These two instructions are used to respectively store and restore the current
context, or continuation. You can see it used in both the person example, with
a very simple use case of keeping positions stored, and in the star example
where it is dynamically over written.

##### `DiscreteRepeat(Num) { Program }`

This takes a Num as an argument, arbitrarily transforms it to an integer (it
just usually rounds it down, don't worry. See OCaml's Pervasive.int_of_float
for more details), executes the given Program the specified mount of time.

Note that it only concatenates the program so far: if you want to play with
backtracking, repetitions with/without modifications, and so on, you have to
play around with `Save` and `Load`.

##### `SetValues(...)` & `Integrate(Num)`

These are the core instructions to understand. Imagine the program as a set of
instructions for your hand, holding a pencil, drawing something on a piece of
paper: `SetValues(...)` prepares the movement, the acceleration, and so on,
while `Integrate(Num)` executes it during an arbitrary unit of **time**.

More specifically, you can set four values with SetValues (the order doesn't matter and there are default values for the forgotten one):

 * **speed** is the speed
 * **accel** is the acceleration
 * **curv** is the curvature (t stands for &#952;)
 * **curv'** is the variation of the curvature


The default values are respectively `speed = 1`, `accel = 0`, `curv = 0` and
`curv' = 0` which means that if you `Integrate(100)` without changing anything,
you'll go straight forward at constant speed for 100 units of times.

##### `Turn(Num)`

This operates an *on the spot* rotation of the hand, the angle depending on the
argument. The square example is the most straightforward use of this
instruction.

*Remark*: this is syntactic sugar in terms of semantics with `Turn(θ)` being
the same as `SetValues(speed=0,curv=θ) ; Integrate(1)`

#### About the noise

The first line can be used to change the amount of noise. The syntax will be
changed later on, currently what you are setting is a dB attenuation of the
noise, therefore 0 leads to infinite noise while inf leads to no noise.

The syntax may be changed but this gives interesting results as it stands:
a value over 10 leads to an almost pixel-perfect shape, while values between
0.5 and 5 lead to more noisy shapes, each value changing the type of noise.
Play around with them to make yourself an intuition.

### Formal Semantics

As everything is not completely decided yet, the semantics of a program at any
given moment is given by its operation semantics for the available interpreter
I wrote. This is going to change one we move on to adding complexity, because
by this time the semantics will need to be fully specified.
